# Personal Demonstration Selling

Convert prospects to customers through direct, tangible experience of your product or service using Estee Lauder's proven 7-step demonstration system.

---

## When to Use

- Selling a product or service where value is not immediately obvious
- Converting interest into actual purchase
- Differentiating from competitors who only describe features
- Building trust with skeptical prospects
- Creating memorable customer experiences

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| offering | Yes | Product or service to be sold |
| customer | Yes | Target customer profile and their situation |
| touchpoints | No | Available channels for demonstration (in-person, video, trial, etc.) |
| constraints | No | Budget, time, or access limitations |

## The Seven-Step System

### Step 1: Approach with Confidence

Do not wait for customers to come to you. Actively approach with warmth and certainty.

**Key insight:** "I would run into strangers in elevators, on the streets—even a Salvation Army lady—and say, 'I could make your skin look so much better.'"

**Execution:**
- Lead with a benefit observation, not a sales pitch
- Express genuine confidence in your ability to help
- Create immediate relevance to their situation

### Step 2: Request Permission to Demonstrate

Ask for the opportunity to show, not tell. Permission creates psychological buy-in.

**Script template:** "May I show you something? It will only take [time] and you'll see [specific benefit]."

**Key insight:** The act of agreeing to a demonstration begins the conversion process.

### Step 3: Create Physical/Experiential Contact

Touch creates connection. Let them experience your offering directly.

**For physical products:**
- Place the product in their hands
- Apply or demonstrate on their person
- Engage multiple senses

**For services/digital:**
- Provide hands-on trial access
- Walk through with screen share
- Let them perform the key action themselves

**Estee's principle:** "Touch your customer, and you're halfway there."

### Step 4: The Half-Face Method (Contrast Demonstration)

Show before-and-after in real time. Let the contrast do the selling.

**Estee's method:** Apply product to one side of the face only. The visible difference speaks louder than any claim.

**Adaptation for any offering:**
- Show current state vs. improved state side by side
- Demonstrate with vs. without your solution
- Create an undeniable visual or experiential comparison

### Step 5: The Mirror Moment

Let them see the transformation with their own eyes. Self-discovery is more persuasive than your claims.

**Execution:**
- Hand them the "mirror"—whatever reveals the result
- Stay silent while they process
- Let them articulate what they notice

**Key insight:** What they tell themselves about the transformation is believed; what you tell them is suspect.

### Step 6: Connect to the Dream

Link the demonstrated result to their deeper desires—confidence, success, transformation.

**Framework:**
- Feature: What it does
- Benefit: What that means
- Dream: How they will feel / who they become

**Estee's insight:** "I didn't sell cosmetics. I sold hope. I sold beauty. I sold the feeling a woman gets when she looks in the mirror and likes what she sees."

### Step 7: The Generous Sample

Even if they don't buy today, give them enough to experience results over time.

**Design principles:**
- Sample must be generous enough for multiple uses
- Include clear instructions for best results
- Embed a callback mechanism (follow-up, expiration, limited offer)

**Estee's principle:** The sample is not charity—it is a conversion tool that works while you sleep.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Personal Demonstration Strategy for [Offering]

### Target Customer
[Profile and key desires/pain points]

### The Dream
[What the customer truly wants—emotional outcome, not feature]

### Demonstration Design

**Approach Script:**
"[Confident opening that leads with benefit]"

**Permission Request:**
"[How you'll ask to demonstrate]"

**Physical/Experiential Contact:**
- [How they will touch/experience the offering]
- [Senses engaged]

**Half-Face Contrast:**
- Before state: [What they see/experience now]
- After state: [What they see/experience with your solution]
- How comparison is made visible: [Method]

**Mirror Moment:**
- [What reveals the result to them]
- [Prompt to get them to articulate]

**Dream Connection Script:**
"[How you link the demonstrated result to their deeper desire]"

### Sample/Trial Design
- What: [What they take away]
- Amount: [Enough for X uses/days]
- Callback: [How you re-engage]

### Adaptation Notes
[Any special considerations for this context]
```

---

## Constraints

- Never describe when you can demonstrate
- Never rush the mirror moment—silence sells
- Sample must be genuinely generous, not stingy
- Adapt the half-face method to your context—the principle is contrast, not literally half a face
- Demonstration must be on THEM, not just shown TO them

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm selling a productivity app to busy professionals. How do I demonstrate value?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Personal Demonstration Strategy for Productivity App

### Target Customer
Overwhelmed professional with too many tasks, scattered across tools, constantly feeling behind.

### The Dream
The feeling of calm control. Knowing exactly what to do next. Ending the day feeling accomplished instead of anxious.

### Demonstration Design

**Approach Script:**
"I notice you mentioned feeling overwhelmed with tasks. May I show you something that could change that in the next 5 minutes?"

**Permission Request:**
"Can I take you through a quick exercise with your actual to-do list? You'll see the difference immediately."

**Physical/Experiential Contact:**
- Have them input their real tasks (not hypotheticals)
- Let them drag, organize, and prioritize themselves
- Put the controls in their hands—they're doing, not watching

**Half-Face Contrast:**
- Before state: Their current chaotic task list (written on paper or in their head)
- After state: Same tasks, organized in the app with clear priorities
- How comparison is made visible: Show both side by side. "Here's where you started. Here's where you are now."

**Mirror Moment:**
- Screen shows their organized day with time blocks and priorities
- Prompt: "What do you notice? How does this feel compared to how your day usually looks?"
- Stay silent. Let them articulate the transformation.

**Dream Connection Script:**
"This is what calm control looks like. Imagine starting every day knowing exactly what matters most, and ending each day knowing you accomplished it. That's not the app—that's you, with the right tool."

### Sample/Trial Design
- What: Full-featured 14-day trial (not crippled free version)
- Amount: Long enough to experience the habit shift (takes ~10 days)
- Callback: Day 7 check-in email: "How is your sense of control? Here's one tip to maximize your next week."

### Adaptation Notes
For remote demos, use screen sharing where THEY control the screen. For trade shows, use their actual phone and email to pull in real tasks. Hypothetical demos don't convert—real data creates real belief.
